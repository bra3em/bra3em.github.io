AttnSleep consists of a feature extraction module based on a powerful feature extractor, followed by a temporal context encoder module that uses a multi-head attention mechanism to capture temporal dependencies among the features. It also addresses the class-imbalance problem via a class-aware loss.}

First, we transform the raw data into two different yet correlated views using weak and strong augmentations. Next, a novel cross-view temporal contrasting module and a contextual contrasting module are proposed to learn robust temporal representations and further learn discriminative representations from the generated augmentated views.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
